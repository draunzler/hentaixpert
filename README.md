# HentaiXpert

## Update 0.3
- Added light and dark mode slider 
- segregated the styles and js scripts in different files
- as imgur don't work in UK, people from UK couldn't see the `nhentai` icon in the search results section, so changed the image address and issue fixed


## Update 0.2.2
- When clicked on the search bar, the outline doesn't show anymore
- Typewriter text effect added to the text below `HentaiXpert` header


## Update 0.2.1
- The `I'm feeling lucky` button is placed on top of the search results, right below the search bar
- color of search button changed and now has hover effect
- `rule34` uses '_' instead of whitespace and hence any search term with a space would fetch no results, so fixed that issue too

Uses 4 websites to fetch whatever anime charcters you search for

Use the `I'm feeling lucky` button to fetch a doujinshi with randomly generated code in `nhentai.net`
